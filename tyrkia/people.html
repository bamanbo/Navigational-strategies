                  <p>
                        About three-fourths of the population lives in towns and cities. 
                        Prior to the mid-20th century, however, the population was predominantly 
                        rural, and its distribution was strongly influenced by the agricultural 
                        potential of the land. Thus, there are pronounced regional variations in 
                        population density, the main contrast being between the interior and the 
                        periphery. The regional coastlands of the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara, 
                        and the Aegean Sea are the most densely settled regions; accounting for less 
                        than two-fifths of the country’s land area, the regions together represent 
                        more than half its population. The Mediterranean coastal region is more thinly 
                        settled, though there are pockets of high population density in the Antalya and 
                        Adana basins. The remainder of the country is relatively lightly populated: the 
                        Anatolian interior and southeast, occupying more than half the country’s territory, 
                        contain less than two-fifths of Turkey’s population. At the beginning of the 21st 
                        century, however, the southeast was the country’s fastest-growing region.

                  <p>
                        Historically, much of Anatolia—especially the east—was populated 
                        by <a href="https://testbook.com/key-differences/what-is-the-difference-betwwen-transhumance-and-nomadic-pastoralism">nomads and transhumants</a>, who migrated seasonally between upland 
                        and plain. Some of their descendants, herders of sheep and goats, 
                        move from plain to mountain, living in tents, while others possess 
                        houses in two or even three villages at different altitudes.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        Over much of the country, the bulk of the population lives in 
                        villages, which are estimated to number at least 50,000. 
                        The average village population tends to vary, and many villages 
                        comprise two or three separate rural settlements some distance apart.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        The typical Turkish village house is a rectangular flat-roofed building, 
                        the colour of the local unbaked brick or stone from which it is made, one 
                        or two stories high. The poorest contain a single room to house family, 
                        livestock, and possessions; the better village houses encompass joint households 
                        of perhaps 20 people living in large compounds, off which lead many living rooms, 
                        stores, stables, and barns. The vast majority of homes fall between these extremes, 
                        and there is great local variation. Commonly, the head of the household and his 
                        wife live and sleep in the main room of the house, which contains the bedding 
                        (stacked away in the daytime), the cooking stove (in some areas a beehive-shaped 
                        oven built into the floor), shelves with cooking pots and implements, a gaily 
                        painted chest containing the woman’s trousseau and personal possessions, and a 
                        chest for flour and grain. People sit on rugs or mats spread on the floor. Many 
                        homes also have at least one room fitted as a guest room, normally for the use of 
                        men only. The guest room has built-in divans running along the walls and very 
                        often a stone or wooden floor. The most marked contrast occurs in the forests 
                        of the northern mountain ranges, where the village homes are made of timber and 
                        have red roofs. Brick, cement, and cinder block are now also becoming common 
                        wherever people can afford them.

                        Cities in Turkey are for the most part of moderate size, 
                        though many have grown rapidly since the 1970s. The largest is 
                        Istanbul; though no longer the capital city, it remains the chief 
                        port and commercial centre, attracting migrants from the entire country. 
                        With its suburbs along the Bosporus, Istanbul forms a sprawling agglomeration 
                        with nearly 15 million inhabitants. The second largest city, Ankara, is of 
                        much more recent origin. Prior to the establishment of the republic, it was 
                        one of many small provincial towns in the interior, but its choice as the 
                        capital city has resulted in a long period of rapid growth. The third largest 
                        city, İzmir, is the port and commercial centre for the prosperous Aegean coastal zone.

                        In 1927 the total population of the Turkish republic was about 
                        13 million; since then it has increased more than sixfold. 
                        Growth was particularly rapid after World War II, reaching 
                        nearly 3 percent annually in the early 1960s, but the rate of 
                        growth has since declined. A fall in the birth rate was the 
                        main factor for the decline, offset somewhat by a decline in the death rate.

                        A notable development of the postwar period was large-scale internal migration, 
                        from rural to urban areas both within each province and over longer distances. 
                        Areas attracting the most migrants were those with major urban agglomerations: 
                        the zone around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea">the Aegean coast</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87ukurova">Adana Plain</a>, and <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara">Ankara.</a>  
                        Net migration losses occurred over much of the interior, particularly the eastern part.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        Another element of population movement was the movement of 
                        Turkish workers abroad. In the early 1980s some two million 
                        Turks lived in various western European countries, three-fourths 
                        of them in what was then West Germany, and there were numerous 
                        short-term Turkish workers in Arab countries, mainly Libya and 
                        Saudi Arabia. The demand for Turkish labour abroad subsequently 
                        declined, and the outflow became much smaller. In the early 21st 
                        century there were roughly six million Turkish citizens living 
                        abroad, of which a majority were living in western Europe.

                  <p>
                        Overall, the population is fairly young. 
                        About half the population is under the age of 30. 
                        The birth rate and the death rate are both slightly below 
                        the world average. Life expectancy is 78 years for women and 73 years for men.
