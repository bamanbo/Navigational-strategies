                  <p>
                        Turkey is a predominantly mountainous country, and true lowland is confined 
                        to the coastal fringes. About one-fourth of the surface has an elevation 
                        above 4,000 feet (1,200 metres), and less than two-fifths lies below 1,500 feet 
                        (460 metres). Mountain crests exceed 7,500 feet (2,300 metres) in many places, 
                        particularly in the east, where Turkey’s highest mountain, Mount Ararat (Ağrı), 
                        reaches 16,945 feet (5,165 metres) close to the borders with Armenia and Iran. 
                        In the southeast the Uludoruk Peak reaches 15,563 feet (4,744 metres); though 
                        further west, the Demirkazık Peak (12,320 feet [3,755 metres]) and Mount Aydos 
                        (11,414 feet [3,479 metres]) are also significant peaks. Steep slopes are common 
                        throughout the country, and flat or gently sloping land makes up barely one-sixth 
                        of the total area. These relief features affect other aspects of the physical 
                        environment, producing climates often much harsher than might be expected for a 
                        country of Turkey’s latitude and reducing the availability and productivity of 
                        agricultural land. Structurally, the country lies within the geologically young 
                        folded-mountain zone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, which in Turkey trends predominantly east to west. 
                        The geology of Turkey is complex, with sedimentary rocks ranging from Paleozoic to 
                        Quaternary, numerous intrusions, and extensive areas of volcanic material. Four 
                        main regions can be identified: the northern folded zone, the southern folded 
                        zone, the central massif, and the Arabian platform.

            <h2 id="rivers">RIVERS</h2>

            <p>
                  Eight main drainage basins may be discerned, of which two cross the country’s 
                  frontiers and six are entirely within Turkish territory. The smallest, in the 
                  far east of the country, is that of the Aras River, which rises south of Erzurum 
                  and flows east for some 250 miles (400 km) to the frontier with Azerbaijan, 
                  eventually reaching the Caspian Sea. The bulk of eastern Turkey, however, is 
                  drained by the Euphrates (Fırat) and Tigris rivers, which flow south for some 
                  780 miles (1,250 km) and 330 (530 km) miles, respectively, before entering Syria 
                  and then Iraq, where they converge to enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>.

            <h2 id="climate">CLIMATE</h2>

            <p>
                  Turkey’s varied climate—generally a dry semicontinental Mediterranean 
                  variant—is heavily influenced by the presence of the sea to the north, 
                  south, and west and by the mountains that cover much of the country. 
                  The sea and the mountains produce contrasts between the interior and 
                  the coastal fringes. Several areas have the winter rainfall maximum typical 
                  of the Mediterranean regime, and summer drought is widespread. However, the 
                  elevation of the country ensures that winters are often much colder than is 
                  common in Mediterranean climates, and there are significant contrasts between 
                  winter and summer temperatures.
            </p>

            <p>
                  January mean temperatures are below freezing throughout the interior, 
                  and in the east there is a sizable area below 23 °F (−5 °C); 
                  extremely low temperatures occur at times, with minima from −4 °F (−20 °C) 
                  in the west to −40 °F (−40 °C) in the east. The duration of snow cover ranges 
                  from two weeks in the warmer areas to four months in some mountainous areas in 
                  the east. The coastal fringes are mild, with January means above 41 °F (5 °C). 
                  Summers generally are hot: July means exceed 68 °F (20 °C) in all but the highest 
                  mountain areas, 77 °F (25 °C) along the Aegean and Mediterranean, and 86 °F (30 °C) 
                  in the southeast. Precipitation is strongly affected by relief; annual totals of 12–16 
                  inches (305–406 mm) are characteristic of much of the interior, whereas the higher parts 
                  of the Pontic and Taurus ranges receive more than 40 inches (1,000 mm).
