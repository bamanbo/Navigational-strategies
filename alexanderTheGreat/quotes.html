                  <h1>The Greatest Quotes From Alexander the Great</h1>
            </div>

		<div class="quote-box">

				"I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion."
			</p>
			<div class="additional-info">

					This quote emphasizes the importance of leadership over the individual 
                              capabilities of team members. Alexander suggests that even a group of 
                              less formidable individuals (the sheep) can become a formidable force 
                              under strong leadership (the lion). It reflects the value he placed on 
                              leadership qualities and strategy in warfare.

			<p>
				"There is nothing impossible to him who will try."
			</p>
                  <div class="additional-info">
				<p>
					This quote speaks to Alexander's ambitious nature and his belief in the 
                              power of determination and effort. It reflects an optimistic view that 
                              challenges can be overcome with persistence and effort, a mindset that 
                              was likely crucial in his extensive military campaigns.

		<div class="quote-box">

				"How should a man be capable of grooming his own horse, or of furbishing his own spear and helmet, if he allows himself to become unaccustomed to tending even his own person, which is his most
				treasured belonging?"
			</p>
                  <div class="additional-info">
				<p>
					This quote highlights the importance of self-care and personal discipline. 
                              Alexander points out that taking care of one's own needs and well-being is 
                              the foundation for being able to take care of other responsibilities. 
                              This can be seen as a reflection of the holistic approach to leadership 
                              and personal development in ancient Greek philosophy.
				</p>

		<div class="quote-box">
			<p>
				"Oh! Most miserable wretch that I am! Why have I not learnt how to swim?"
			</p>
                  <div class="additional-info">
				<p>
					This quote, somewhat humorously, reflects on the limitations of even the 
                              greatest leaders or warriors. It's a reminder that no one is capable 
                              of everything and that there are always new skills to learn and 
                              new areas in which to grow. This may also indicate a moment of 
                              self-reflection or humility from a figure often known for his 
                              confidence and ambition.
