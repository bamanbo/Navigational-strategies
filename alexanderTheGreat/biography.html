			<h1>Early life</h1>

			<p>
                  Lineage and childhood Archaeological site of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pella">Pella, Greece,</a> Alexander's
			birthplace Alexander III was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of
			Macedon, on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion,
			which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is
			uncertain). He was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon, Philip
			II, and his fourth wife, Olympias (daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of
			Epirus). Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was
			his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to
			Alexander.

                  Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood.
			According to the ancient Greek biographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, on the eve of the
			consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was
			struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread "far and wide" before
			dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself,
			in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's
			image. Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams:
			that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of
			her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were
			divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of
			Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told
			Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.

                  <p>
                  On the day
			Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on
			the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his
			general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies and
			that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this
			day, the <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Temple_of_Artemis_at_Ephesus/">Temple of Artemis in Ephesus</a>, one of the Seven Wonders of the
			World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had burnt
			down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such
			legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his
			instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from
			conception.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike,
			sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his
			childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a relative of his
			mother, and by Lysimachus of Acarnania. Alexander was raised in the
			manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the lyre, ride,
			fight, and hunt. When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from
			Thessaly brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen
			talents. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away.
			Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to
			tame the horse, which he eventually managed. Plutarch stated that
			Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son
			tearfully, declaring: "My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your
			ambitions. Macedon is too small for you", and bought the horse for him.
			Alexander named it Bucephalas, meaning "ox-head". Bucephalas carried
			Alexander as far as India. When the animal died (because of old age,
			according to Plutarch, at age 30), Alexander named a city after him, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boukephala_and_Nikaia"> Bucephala.</a>

		<h1>Education</h1>

			When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a tutor, 
			and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus, 
			the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the 
			Academy to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> 
			and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. 
			In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's 
			hometown of Stageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by 
			buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those 
			who were in exile.
	
			Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children 
			of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. 
			Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, 
			and are often known as the "Companions". Aristotle taught Alexander 
			and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, 
			logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed 
			a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; 
			Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.
	
			Alexander was able to quote Euripides from memory.


	
			During his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the 
			Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years 
			as they opposed Artaxerxes III. Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter 
			Barsine, possible future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian 
			court from 352 to 342 BC, as well as Amminapes, future satrap of Alexander, or a 
			Persian nobleman named Sisines. This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of 
			Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management 
			of the Macedonian state.
	
			Suda writes that Anaximenes of Lampsacus was one of Alexander's teachers, and that 
			Anaximenes also accompanied Alexander on his campaigns.
